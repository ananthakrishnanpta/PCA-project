# PCA-project

##  - Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a statistical procedure that allows you to summarize the information content in large data tables by means of a smaller set of “summary indices” that can be more easily visualized and analyzed.

## In this project , we use PCA to improve the accuracy of a linear regression machine learning model.
## The data set contains details about houses and their house prices. 
## The model is meant to predict the house prices given the features.
